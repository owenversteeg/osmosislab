A website for our osmosis lab

Procedure 1
-The diffusion through a cell lab (hydrochloric cup, basic artificial cell. remember the odd one out, and that we have a total of three data points.

Procedure 2
-The dialsys tubing osmosis lab (to test for linerarity in concentration of solution diffusion rates)

Procedure 3
-The yam lab (overnight soak in diferent concentrations of sucrose solutions and then testing the mass)

made an intro page, did all 3 of the intros. somebody needs to edit them please! I'll also work on the interpratation of results for all 3 and edit some other stuff too when it gets done. Owen share the data tables please. -ERIK
